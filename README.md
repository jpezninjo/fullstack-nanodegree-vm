rdb-fullstack
=============

Common code for the Relational Databases and Full Stack Fundamentals courses


##Project Overview
In this project, you’ll be writing a Python module that uses the PostgreSQL database to keep track of players and matches in a game tournament.

You will develop a database schema to store the game matches between players. You will then write a Python module to rank the players and pair them up in matches in a tournament.

###Why This Project?
Modern data-driven applications require developers that know how to store data and interact programmatically with that data. In this project, you’ll design a database based off of a provided specification and use case and then write code that makes use of that data.

###What Will I Learn?
You will learn how to architect and develop a database containing fully normalized data within multiple tables. You’ll then learn how to modify this data and query it to meet the demands of a variety of use cases.

###How Does This Help My Career?
Persistent data is the key feature that turns static websites into dynamic data-driven web applications
Properly establishing data relationships and using the appropriate data types ensures your applications perform efficiently and error free
